## 🌱 Git Workflow

We follow a **branching strategy** based on GitHub Flow

### Branches

- `main` → stable, production-ready code
- `dev` → integration branch for new features before release
- `feature/<feature-name>` → feature development (e.g., `feature/login-system`)
- `bugfix/<bug-name>` → bug fixes
- `hotfix/<hotfix-name>` → urgent production fixes
- `document/<document-name>` → document/documentation updates

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/flashcard
   ```

## 📌 Contribution Guide
